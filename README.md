# About the 3x+1 (Collatz) Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture is an unsolved mathematical problem that starts with any positive integer:

    If the number is even, divide it by 2
    If it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
    Repeat the process with the result

The conjecture states that no matter what number you start with, you will eventually reach 1.
